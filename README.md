Odin Landing Page Project

For the landing page project I will use what I have learned about Flexboxes to recreate images given in the project assignment for the Flexbox module of the Odin Project Foundations Course. This project was challenging in all the right ways, and I had a ton of fun doing it even if I had to sit there scratching my head for a while before solving a confusing problem. In the end filling in the text and images for the website turned out to be a lot of fun. Things are getting super interesting, I am very excited to learn more. I hope you enjoy the silly text inside!
